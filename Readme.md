# iter 1
Is a social media web application project which allows the user to register an account, once the account is registered  there is an entry created in the database for the particular user. Now once a user registers and creates and account they are able to to follow friends and pages of their choice, like, comment and share pictures, message people. This application is being developed as part of the coursework for CS5610. This project is a collective effort among  three students- Adithya Chandrashekar, Bhoomika Madhukar and Nikitha Tejpal. 

We have used Mongoose database and established a connection to Mongo DB atlas. Using React and Redux we are developing the various other functionalities of this application. 

For the first iteration we worked on the registration, login, logout, authentication feature of this application. Bhoomika was responsible for the router and authentication section, she was assisted by Nikitha when there were some issues encountered in the authentication feature development. Nikitha worked on the registration and development of the UI of the application so far. Adithya was reponsible for the login and logout features and was assisted by both Bhoomika and Nikitha when there were issues related to these two features. 

Some of the screenshots showing the various features of the application so far:
